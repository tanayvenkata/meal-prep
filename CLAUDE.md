## Who this is for / how to work

- The human is a capable beginner: has coded and built small projects, but has **never
  built a real end-to-end full-stack app.** Just starting on DSA and system design.
- Strong subject-matter background in **finance**; comfortable cooking.
- **TEACH, don't blitz.** Explain the *why* before the *how*. Prefer understanding over
  speed. It is fine — encouraged — to go slowly, build small, and explain each piece.
- When we hit a "now we need X" moment, write it down in the Decision Log below so the
  human accumulates a personal record of *why* the architecture grew the way it did.

## The vision (eventual)

A personal cooking app: stores my pantry/ingredients, lets me add more (eventually via a
photo of a receipt), and suggests recipes based on what I have, what I'm in the mood for,
and how much time I have — like chatting with Claude, but with persistent memory of my
kitchen. Stretch goals: voice / speech-to-text for hands-free cooking. (A separate
finance-tracker app may come later as project #2 — kept separate on purpose.)

This is a **learning project first, product second.** Not trying to make money.

## Milestone roadmap (build small, ship each one)

- [x] **M1 — Streaming chat clone.** DONE. Text box → send → Claude streams back live.
      Full loop working: browser → /api/chat → ai.ts → Claude → streamed to screen.
- [x] **M2 — Deploy to Vercel.** DONE. Live at https://meal-prep-tawny-kappa.vercel.app —
      same `curl -N` from M1 works against the public URL. Public deploy pipeline proven.
- [x] **M3 — Pantry CRUD.** DONE + DEPLOYED. Add/edit/delete ingredients, persisted in
      Supabase Postgres. Full loop: /pantry page → fetch → /api/pantry route → db.ts boundary
      → postgres driver → Supabase. Survives refresh; verified live (curl'd CRUD against the
      prod URL). `DATABASE_URL` set in Vercel for Production + Preview. *Postgres earned its
      place* (we felt state vanish on refresh first, then added the DB).
      ⚠️ **Known open door (deliberate, fix at M5):** `/api/pantry` has NO auth — anyone with
      the URL can add/delete items. The SECRET (DATABASE_URL) is safe (server-only, Pattern A);
      only the *data* is unprotected. Low risk now (random unshared URL, trivial stakes,
      single-user). A stopgap was deliberately NOT added (throwaway once M5 lands).
- [x] **M4 — Recipe suggestions.** DONE + DEPLOYED. Pantry-aware chat at `/recipes` — fetches
      pantry from DB, injects as system prompt, streams Claude's response. Two halves joined.
      `src/components/ChatWindow.tsx` extracted to eliminate duplicate chat UI logic.
- [x] **M5 — Auth + per-user pantry.** DONE + DEPLOYED. Supabase Auth (email/password). Each
      user has their own pantry. JWT verified on every API request. RLS enabled on `items` table.
      `supabase.ts` boundary + `login/page.tsx` + `SignOutButton` in layout. M3 open door closed.
- [x] **M5.5 — Tests.** DONE. 32 tests across 6 files. Vitest.
      ✅ API route tests — pantry/recipes/chat, 3 zones each (auth gate, input validation, happy path)
      ✅ db.ts integration tests — real local Postgres, SQL correctness + user isolation
      ✅ auth.ts tests — 3 outcomes of getUserId (no token, valid token, token but no user)
      ✅ middleware tests — 3 branches (public route, unauthenticated, authenticated)
      ✅ helpers/fixtures.ts — shared fake data factories (Rule of Three)
      ⬜ Frontend component tests — deliberately skipped (components too thin, redundant with route tests)
      ⬜ E2E tests — deliberately skipped (app still evolving; add after M6)
- [x] **M5.6 — CI/CD + local hooks.** GitHub Actions on every push. Husky pre-commit (lint) + pre-push (build + unit tests). Testing pyramid: unit locally, integration in CI.
- [ ] **M6 — Voice mode.** Web Speech API (free, in-browser) first.
- [ ] **M7 — Receipt scanning (OCR).** Evaluate if it's worth it by now.

## Architecture (current — the lightweight system design)

```
   BROWSER (frontend)          SERVER (backend)              ANTHROPIC
   src/app/page.tsx            src/app/api/chat/route.ts     Claude
   - text box                  - holds the SECRET api key    - the model
   - message list              - calls the AI via ai.ts
        |  POST /api/chat            |  stream                    |
        | ------------------------>  | -----------------------> |
        | <------ stream tokens ---- | <----- stream tokens ----|
```

- **Why a server step at all?** The API key must NEVER reach the browser (anyone could
  read it in dev tools). The backend is the only place the key lives.
- **Why Next.js?** It gives us frontend AND backend in one project (`page.tsx` = browser,
  `api/.../route.ts` = server), so we don't juggle two repos while learning.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind** — scaffolded via `create-next-app`.
- **AI: native Anthropic SDK**, isolated behind `src/lib/ai.ts` (see Decision Log).
- **Database: Postgres via Supabase** — *not yet*. Added at M3.
- Node 26, npm 11.

## Decisions so far (one line each — the "why" was discussed in chat when made)

- **Postgres deferred to M3** — nothing to persist until pantry CRUD exists.
- **Lightweight design now, not heavy** — single-user MVP; learn requirements by building.
- **Native Anthropic SDK, not OpenRouter** — behind `src/lib/ai.ts` boundary; swap later.
- **Prompt caching deferred to ~M4** — needs a big reused prefix (>=1,024 tok) to do anything.
- **No OpenTelemetry yet** — it monitors prod; we have none.
- **Secrets only in `.env.local`** (git-ignored); `.env.example` is the committed template.
- **Deployed on Vercel, not Railway** (M2) — brief's reasoning still held: Vercel is the
  verified Next.js adapter (zero build config), and the Vercel+Supabase pairing keeps the
  M3 DB decision cleanly deferred. Railway tooling being in-session wasn't a reason.
- **Env vars live per-platform, pasted manually** — `.env.local` for local, Vercel's
  encrypted store for prod. Same var name, two homes, neither in git. The manual paste
  IS the security feature (each copy is a deliberate, auditable act), not missing polish.
- **Secrets manager (Doppler/Infisical) deferred to ~M3–M5** — the "one source of truth,
  connectors sync from it" pattern the user asked about. Overhead for 1 secret in 2 places;
  earns its place once secrets cross ~4 across local + prod + preview (Supabase URL/keys + auth).
- **M3: Pattern A (own backend), not Pattern B (Supabase client in the browser)** — Supabase
  pushes browser→DB-direct via `supabase-js`+RLS. We chose browser→our `/api/pantry`→DB instead:
  it teaches the fundamentals (endpoints, the secret boundary, backend logic) and mirrors the
  M1 chat shape. Pattern B hides exactly what we're here to learn, and its guard (RLS) is off
  until M5 anyway. More code = more learning, and it's the transferable kind.
- **M3: raw SQL via `postgres` driver, not an ORM (Prisma/Drizzle)** — SQL is the forever,
  transferable skill; an ORM hides the SQL we're here to learn. Learn the fundamental deeply
  now; reach for an ORM later, once we can read the SQL it generates and choose it on purpose.
- **M3: `src/lib/db.ts` is THE DB boundary** — only file that imports the driver / knows the
  connection string. Mirrors `ai.ts`. Swap Supabase/driver/host = change this one file. Will
  split into a `db/` folder (connection + per-table files) when it outgrows one file, keeping
  the same principle. Same swappability reasoning as the `ai.ts` decision above.
- **M3: transaction-pooler connection string (port 6543), not direct connection** — direct is
  IPv6-only by default and would break on Vercel's serverless functions; the pooler is built
  for stateless/serverless and is the standard Next-on-Vercel + Postgres choice.
- **M3: RLS off, deferred to M5** — RLS distinguishes *users*, and there are none until auth.
  Turning it on now (no login) would lock us out of our own table. Security sequenced to when
  it's real, not skipped. `items` table: DB-generated `id` (bigint identity), `name not null`,
  `quantity` optional, `created_at` default now() — the DB owns ids (no more `Date.now()` hack).
- **M3: re-fetch the list after every change (DB = source of truth), not local state updates** —
  simplest, always-correct mental model: screen mirrors the DB. Optimize to local/optimistic
  updates only when a *concrete* pain appears (visible lag, cost at scale, a UX requirement).
- **M3: `next/link` for navigation, not `<a href>`** — `<Link>` does client-side transitions
  (no full reload, preserves React state) and prefetches. Home↔Pantry linked both ways.
- **M4: system prompt built in `/api/recipes`, not injected from the frontend** — the route
  fetches the pantry and builds the `system` string server-side on every request. Frontend never
  sees or touches the system prompt. Same "secrets/logic stay server-side" principle as M1.
- **M4: `/api/recipes` is a separate route, not a modification of `/api/chat`** — built in
  isolation first (bottom-up), then integrated via shared `ChatWindow` component. Same pattern
  real firms use: new feature separate → verify → merge/share.
- **M4: shared `ChatWindow` component, not duplicated page logic** — same principle as `db.ts`
  and `ai.ts`: extract when duplication is *logic*, not just when two files import the same thing.
  Pages are now just configuration (title, apiRoute, placeholder, links).
- **M4: pantry re-fetched on every message turn, not cached** — simple and correct for now.
  Optimization (cache the pantry for a session) deferred until lag is actually felt.
- **M4: UI polish deferred to after M5** — styling is cosmetic; auth changes the data model.
  Polish after the structure is stable.
- **Post-M5: switched to `@supabase/ssr`** — old `createClient` stored session in localStorage (server-blind);
  `createBrowserClient` stores in cookies so middleware can read the session on every request.
- **Post-M5: middleware.ts at project root** — gates all routes except `/login` before React renders;
  appends `?returnTo=` so login can redirect back to the original destination.
- **Post-M5: `src/lib/auth.ts` boundary** — `getUserId()` extracted from pantry+recipes routes; `/api/chat` now also requires JWT.
- **M3 known debt (deliberate, not drift):** pantry page uses inline `style={{}}` while the chat
  page uses Tailwind `className`. Cosmetic only, crosses no boundary — left for a later styling
  pass rather than churned mid-milestone. Also: front-end mutate() helper has no `res.ok` check
  yet (backend 400s are silently swallowed) — the natural next error-handling lesson.
- **M5.5: Vitest, not Jest** — near-identical API, but faster and native ESM support; standard for Next.js/Vite projects now.
- **M5.5: route tests mock db+auth, db tests hit real local DB** — each layer tests itself, mocks everything below. Route tests prove the route logic; db tests prove the SQL. No overlap.
- **M5.5: `src/__tests__/` mirrors `src/` structure** — no hunting; test file path = source file path, just under `__tests__/`.
- **M5.5: three zones per endpoint** — auth gate, input validation, happy path. One test per branch in the code.
- **M5.5: db tests use real local Postgres via Supabase CLI** — `supabase start` boots local stack; `beforeAll` creates test users, `afterEach` wipes items, `afterAll` cleans users. No mocks at the db layer.
- **M5.5: helpers/fixtures.ts for shared fake data** — extracted at Rule of Three (3 files reusing same Item shape). `vi.mock()` stays per-file (Vitest hoists it; can't be shared).
- **M5.5: user isolation tested explicitly on updateItem + deleteItem** — write ops that take a row id can silently affect another user's data if `and user_id = $userId` is missing. Read ops and insert ops don't have this risk.
- **M5.5: middleware tested by mocking `@supabase/ssr`** — same nested mock pattern as route tests; three branches: public route passthrough, unauthenticated redirect (with ?returnTo=), authenticated passthrough.
- **M5.5: auth.ts mock defined before vi.mock() factory** — `getSupabase()` creates a fresh `createClient()` on every call; defining `mockGetUser` outside the factory and referencing it inside ensures all calls share the same mock function.
- **M5.5: `npm test` = watch mode, `npm test -- --run` = run once** — watch mode for active development; --run for CI and one-off checks.
- **M5.5: frontend + E2E deliberately skipped** — components are thin wrappers around API calls (redundant with route tests); E2E better after app stabilizes post-M6.
- **M5.5→M6: GitHub Actions CI** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; triggers on every push + PR to main. Runs lint → build → all 32 tests. Boots Supabase local stack in CI so db integration tests hit real Postgres. Ubuntu VM, Node 20, npm cache.
- **M5.5→M6: Husky pre-commit + pre-push hooks** — pre-commit runs lint only (~3s, every commit); pre-push runs build + 26 unit tests (~30s, no Supabase needed). Defense in depth: catch errors on your machine before CI sees them.
- **M5.5→M6: test:unit vs test:integration split** — `npm run test:unit` runs the 26 mock-based tests (no infrastructure); `npm run test:integration` runs the 6 db tests (needs `supabase start`). pre-push uses test:unit so it works without Supabase running locally.
- **M5.5→M6: branch protection deferred** — requires GitHub Team plan for private repos. pre-push hook is the local gate; CI is the remote gate. Branch protection is the repo-level enforcement layer — add when repo goes public or plan upgrades.
- Unifying principle: *defer capability until the need is real; structure so adding it is cheap.*

## Current state

- **Pantry loop (M3):** `src/app/pantry/page.tsx` → `src/app/api/pantry/route.ts` → `src/lib/db.ts` → Supabase
- **Recipe loop (M4):** `src/app/recipes/page.tsx` → `src/app/api/recipes/route.ts` → `db.ts` + `ai.ts`
- **Auth (M5):** `src/lib/supabase.ts` → `login/page.tsx` + `SignOutButton` + JWT on all user-scoped routes
- **Deployed:** https://meal-prep-tawny-kappa.vercel.app — auto-deploys on push to `main`.
- **Next:** M6 (voice) or testing or UI polish — see known debt below.

## Known debt & gaps (things real apps have that we don't yet)

### Security
- ⬜ **Rate limiting** — `/api/recipes` is unprotected from spam; someone could rack up Anthropic bill
- ⬜ **Input sanitization** — `name` is validated for existence but not length/content

### Reliability
- ✅ **Error handling** — all API routes have auth checks, input validation, and try/catch around DB/stream calls; frontend checks `res.ok`, sets error state, and displays inline messages; streaming errors caught and surfaced
- ⬜ **Loading states** — no spinner while pantry loads
- ⬜ **Empty states** — pantry shows nothing with no message when empty
- ✅ **Auth redirect** — middleware gates all routes except `/login`; appends `?returnTo=` so users land where they were headed after login
- ⬜ **Tests** — no unit or integration tests yet (highest value: API routes + db.ts functions)

### Observability
- ⬜ **Error monitoring** — no Sentry or equivalent; silent failures in prod go unnoticed
- ⬜ **Logging** — no structured server logs beyond what Vercel captures

### Developer experience
- ✅ **Shared `auth.ts`** — `getUserId()` extracted to `src/lib/auth.ts`; all three API routes import from it
- ⬜ **UI consistency** — pantry page uses inline `style={{}}`, chat/recipes use Tailwind `className`

### Future skills to learn (different domain, not urgent)
- **Docker** — containerize the app so it runs the same everywhere; relevant when moving off Vercel
- **Kubernetes** — orchestrate containers at scale; needed only with real traffic
- **OpenTelemetry** — structured observability for prod; earns its place once the app has real users

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start local dev server (http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run lint` — lint
- `npm test` — run all tests in watch mode (requires local Supabase running for db.ts tests)
- `npm run test:unit` — run 26 unit/mock tests only (no Supabase needed)
- `npm run test:integration` — run 6 db integration tests only (requires Supabase running)
- `npm test -- --run` — run all tests once and exit

### Before running db.ts tests (once per dev session)
1. Open OrbStack
2. `supabase start` — boots local Postgres at postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres

### When schema changes (remote DB changed)
- `supabase db pull` — pulls new schema into supabase/migrations/
- `supabase db push` — pushes local migration files to remote DB
